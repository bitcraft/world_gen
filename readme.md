Infinite automap world demo
===========================


Basic demo of an infinite world using perlin noise with automapper.

This game is capable of different 'biomes' and smart tile edge rendering.

For example, the borders between water and grass use the correct tiles.

The world map is deterministic and infinite.

This is likely to be very slow right now.

#### Requirements

Requires the following:

* pygame
* pyscroll

**Please update these dependencies if you already have them installed**

Install/Update them using pip:
```
pip install -U pygame pytmx pyscroll
```


Running the demo
================

```
python main.py
```

Arrow keys move around.
